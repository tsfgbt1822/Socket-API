These files are in C (unsure what version, very recent)

I used VisualStudios code (2022). In order to run on visual studios, i click on the folder in my files, and hit open with visual studios.

Then in the visual studios terminal (Ubuntu), compile with the command:

gcc server.c -o server

and then run with 

./server

to start the server



Then open another terminal window with ubuntu and compile with:

gcc client.c -o client

and run with

./client

to start up the client. Then follow the prompts on the client window to interact with the chat room.
